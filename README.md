 A Web application designed to seamlessly collect and present comprehensive information about the processes running on a computer system. This user-friendly tool provides valuable insights into system resources, aiding users in monitoring and managing processes efficiently. With its straightforward functionality, the Process Manager simplifies the task of understanding and overseeing the dynamic aspects of a computer's operation. 

 Our Operating Systems group project is the creation of a process manager. This process manager is meant to identify the system and user processes on a computer. Each process that is collected will show the CPU, Memory, and I/O utilization as a %. It also tags whether the process is CPU or I/O bound.
 The process manager we made is a web application designed to be used by the user in their browser of choice. For user input they just need to interact with the buttons on the web interface to display the system information they wanted to acquire as the output. Our web app was made using html/CSS/JavaScript along with NodeJS/Express. This means that in order to test and run our project you would need to just install NodeJS on your computer and use an IDE with an interactive terminal to run some commands to host the web app (Easiest recommended IDE to use would be Visual Studio Code). Once you’ve opened our project folder in your IDE, you would need to run the following two commands in your IDE terminal to start hosting and running our project. The first command to run is “npm install express systeminformation” (This command sets up Express which is a web framework used to host web apps). After that you would then run the command “node server.js” to launch the project. Then you can open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with our web application.
